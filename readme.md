Station allows developers to auto-generate, configure, and deploy an admin interface with advanced scaffolding, migrations and models for their Laravel software. It includes an artisan build command and a simple but extensible UI.

If you are tired of creating `CRUD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>`_-capable interfaces from scratch, then Station may be perfect for you. In a few minutes you can have a back-end admin installed and ready for use by you, your customers, and your customers' users.

Station shines when used as a CMS however it is *not* your typical template-based CMS system. It does not include front-end templates or layouts. Instead it is intended to be used as a database, content, and user management system. It takes away the heavy-lifting involved in creating a back-end for your web site or application. But, it leaves the front-end a blank canvas for your creativity!
