## Laravel 5: Backend UI for Content & User Management

**Note: Looking for a Laravel 4 version? Use this: https://github.com/thecanarycollective/station**

**Documentation is coming to the Github wiki very soon**

Tired of creating and configuring similar models and controllers which deal with basic CRUD, validation and user role-based capabilities? Station allows developers to setup and configure a backend CMS for a Laravel app/site very quickly.
