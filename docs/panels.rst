Anatomy of a Panel 
==================

Panels are the heart and soul of Station. Each panel contains all of the functionality necessary for a user to manipulate a specific type of data in your database. There are numerous options for panels and elements giving you the flexibility to craft the back-end tools to fit virtually any scenario or database structure.

Typically each panel maps to a database table one-to-one. However, a panel can also contain one or more **subpanels** as well as references to other tables for lookup capabilities.

A panel can also be complete overriden so you can build your own functionality from scratch, but within the user-authenticated comfort of Station.
