About Station 
------------- 

Station allows developers to auto-generate, configure, and deploy an admin interface with advanced scaffolding, migrations and models for their Laravel software. It includes an artisan build command and a simple but extensible UI.

If you are tired of creating `CRUD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete>`_-capable interfaces, Station may be perfect for you. In a few minutes you can have a back-end admin installed and ready for use by you, your customers, and your customers' users.

Features 
-------- 

* One 
* Two
* Three 

Requirements
------------ 

* GD (compiled with PHP, if you want to take advantage of the image resizing features)

Todos
----- 

* Replace `Session::*`
* Replace `Request::*`
* Replace `->lists()` - convert to array - this now returns an object
